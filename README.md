[`nobel-prize-data`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nobel-prize-data) is a JSON dataset containing details about all Nobel Prizes and Laureates since 1901.

I created `nobel-prize-data` when I was working on [`iaseth/josn`](https://github.com/iaseth/josn).

I am using [`readmix`](https://github.com/iaseth/readmix) for generating this README.
